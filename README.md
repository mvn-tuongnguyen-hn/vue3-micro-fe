## VueJs Module Federation

This example demos consumption of federated modules from a Webpack bundle. `appHost` app depends on a component exposed by `appRemote` app.

## Running Demo

Run `yarn start` . This will build and serve both `appHost` and `appRemote` on ports 3000 and 3001 respectively.

- HOST: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- REMOTE: [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
